# Scientific Calculator

A feature-rich scientific calculator that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations, scientific operations, and manage memory with the ability to switch between dark and light mode.

## Features

### 1. **Simple Operations**
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Percentage (`%`)
- Square Root (`âˆš`)
- Exponentiation (`^` or `**`)

### 2. **Scientific Operations**
- Trigonometric Functions: `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`
- Inverse Trigonometric Functions: `asin()`, `acos()`, `atan()`
- Logarithmic Functions: `log()`, `ln()`
- Power Functions: `x^y`
- Exponential Functions: `e^x`
- Radians and Degrees: Toggle between radians and degrees for trigonometric operations

### 3. **Memory Operations**
- **Add to Memory**: Adds the current value to the memory.
- **Subtract from Memory**: Subtracts the current value from the memory.
- **Recall Memory**: Retrieves the value from memory.
- **Clear Memory**: Clears the memory.

### 4. **Toggle Dark and Light Mode**
- Switch between dark and light themes for a better user experience.
- The mode is toggled with a simple switch button, and the theme is persisted across sessions.

### 5. **Responsive Design**
- The calculator is responsive and works seamlessly across various devices like mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Usage

1. **Performing Basic Operations**: 
   - Enter numbers and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and hit `=` to see the result.
   
2. **Performing Scientific Operations**:
   - Use trigonometric, logarithmic, or exponential functions by selecting them from the scientific operations section.
   - Example: `sin(30)`, `log(10)`.

3. **Memory Operations**:
   - Use memory buttons (`M+`, `M-`, `MR`, `MC`) to add to, subtract from, recall, and clear memory.

4. **Toggle Theme**:
   - Use the `Toggle Dark Mode` button at the top to switch between dark and light modes.
